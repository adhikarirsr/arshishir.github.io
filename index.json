The idea was to watch his old Coursera lectures and meet once a week and discuss those ideas.\nFortunately that summer, I also got an opportunity to mentor a high school student. He wanted to explore some computer science related topic. So, I decided to teach him machine learning. This decision forced me to pick a book and some sets of lecture notes. I choose Pattern Recognition and Machine Learning (PRML) by Christopher Bishop and Deep learning specialization by Andrew Ng. With the added responsibility of teaching, I strated going through first few chapters of PRML. Based on PRML and Deep Learning specialization, I made lecture notes so that I could convey those ideas clearly. It was fun!\nIn the mean that I came across some other very useful resources. Here’s a list of some of those resources:\nSupport Vector Machine  One of the most gentle and clear introductions to SVM by Patrick Winston\n Interesting and very helpful SVM recitation session by Jessica Noss\n  Machine Learning lectures by Nando Freitas I haven’t gone through the whole lecture series. However, I watched quite a few lectures by him and they are some of the clearest introductions those topics on ML that I found on youtube.\nMachine Learning lectures by Ali Ghodsi One of the hidden gems of youtube Machine learning lecture series . I have watched a couple of this lecture and they are brilliant. I would highly recommend his lecture on Decision Tree.\nThis is by no means a complete list. I went through many more resources. I will add those and the ones that I am currently going through soon.\n ","date":1549170000,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1549170000,"objectID":"074a4306d5932cf3558b174f03728e1a","permalink":"https://arshishir.github.io/post/expo_in_ml/","publishdate":"2019-02-03T00:00:00-05:00","relpermalink":"/post/expo_in_ml/","section":"post","summary":"For the past year or so, I have been dabbling in machine learning.

The stability of this complex was a puzzle for many years, since in vitro studies could reconstitute various stable subsets of the individual proteins, but never the entirety. The missing ingredient turned out to be mechanical tension: a recent experiment that applied physiological forces to the complex with an optical tweezer dramatically increased its lifetime, a phenomenon known as catch bonding. However, in the absence of a crystal structure for the full complex, the microscopic details of the catch bond mechanism remain mysterious. Building on structural clues that point to α-catenin as the force transducer, we present a quantitative theoretical model for how the catch bond arises, fully accounting for the experimental lifetime distributions. The underlying hypothesis is that force induces a rotational transition between two conformations of α-catenin, overcoming a significant energy barrier due to a network of salt bridges. This transition allosterically regulates the energies at the interface between α-catenin and F-actin. The model allows us to predict these energetic changes, as well as highlighting the importance of the salt bridge rotational barrier. By stabilizing one of the α-catenin states, this barrier could play a role in how the complex responds to additional in vivo binding partners like vinculin. Since significant conformational energy barriers are a common feature of other adhesion systems that exhibit catch bonds, our model can be adapted into a general theoretical framework for integrating structure and function in a variety of force-regulated protein complexes.","tags":["biophysics","cadherin","modeling","actin","catch-bond"],"title":"Unraveling the mechanism of the cadherin-catenin-actin catch bond","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Mark P.

The many-body effects of solvent on the structure of an n-mer polymer chain can be formally mapped to an exact n-body solvation potential. Here, we use a pair decomposition of this n-body potential to construct a set of two-body potentials for a Lennard-Jones (LJ) polymer chain in explicit LJ solvent. The solvation potentials are built from numerically exact results for 5-mer chains in solvent combined with an approximate asymptotic expression for the solvation potential between sites that are distant along the chain backbone. These potentials map the many-body chain-in-solvent problem to a few-body single-chain problem and can be used to study a chain of arbitrary length, thereby dramatically reducing the computational complexity of the polymer chain-in-solvent problem. We have constructed solvation potentials at a large number of state points across the LJ solvent phase diagram including the vapor, liquid, and super-critical regions. We use these solvation potentials in single-chain Monte Carlo (MC) simulations with n ≤ 800 to determine the size, intramolecular structure, and scaling behavior of chains in solvent. To assess our results, we have carried out full chain-in-solvent MC simulations (with n ≤ 100) and find that our solvation potential approach is quantitatively accurate for a wide range of solvent conditions for these chain lengths.","tags":["solvation","Lennard-Jones","Accurate"],"title":"Conformation of a flexible chain in explicit solvent: Accurate solvation potentials for Lennard-Jones chains","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Mark P.

In a dense solvent, local chain structure often mirrors the pure solvent structure, whereas, in a dilute solvent, the chain can strongly perturb the solvent structure which, in turn, can lead to either chain expansion or compression. Here we use Monte Carlo (MC) simulation to study such solvent effects for a short Lennard-Lones (LJ) chain in monomeric LJ solvent. For an n-site chain molecule in solution these many-body solvent effects can be formally mapped to an n-body solvation potential. We have previously shown that for hard-sphere and square-well chain-in-solvent systems this n-body potential can be decomposed into a set of two-body potentials. Here, we show that this decomposition is also valid for the LJ system. Starting from high precision MC results for the n = 5 LJ chain-in-solvent system, we use a Boltzmann inversion technique to compute numerically exact sets of two-body solvation potentials which map the many-body chain-in-solvent problem to a few-body single-chain problem. We have carried out this mapping across the full solvent phase diagram including the dilute vapor, dense liquid, and supercritical regions and find that these sets of solvation potentials are able to encode the complete range of solvent effects found in the LJ chain-in-solvent system. We also show that these two-site solvation potentials can be used to obtain accurate multi-site intramolecular distribution functions and we discuss the application of these exact short chain potentials to the study of longer chains in solvent.","tags":["solvation","Lennard-Jones","Exact"],"title":"Conformation of a flexible chain in explicit solvent: Exact solvation potentials for short Lennard-Jones chains","type":"publication"}]
