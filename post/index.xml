      <description>For the past year or so, I have been dabbling in machine learning. Last summer, I decided to spend some serious amount of time exploring ML. As a beginner, I got overwhelmed by the plethora of resources out there. Meanwhile, I convinced one of my friends to go on this exploration with me. We decided to go through lectures on machine learning by Andrew Ng. The idea was to watch his old Coursera lectures and meet once a week and discuss those ideas.</description>

      <description>This is my attempt to keep track of interesting science related websites and blogs
Blogs  https://johncarlosbaez.wordpress.com/ https://mgbukov.github.io/  Websites  John Carlo Baez  http://math.ucr.edu/home/baez/ This webpage has many interesting topics. I particularly find his exposition to information geometry (http://math.ucr.edu/home/baez/information/) very useful. http://math.ucr.edu/home/baez/stoch_stable.pdf Quantum Techniques for Stochastic Mechanics. A monogram, I hope to go through one day.   Gavin E. Crooks
 http://threeplusone.com/gec/ http://threeplusone.com/FieldGuide.pdf (Field Guide to Continuous Probability Distributions) http://threeplusone.</description>

      <description>As a Ph.D. student, we are exposed to lots of new ideas and concepts. The posts on websites are my attempt to keep track of those ideas and concepts. I started a blog a couple of years ago but failed to maintain it. This is my second go at it.
I set up this website using Hugo framework with the academic theme. I have high hopes from this set up as it natively supports $\LaTeX$.</description>
